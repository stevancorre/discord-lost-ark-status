# Lost Ark status tracker bot for Discord

This bot is made to check the Lost Ark's servers status.  
I got this idea when I tried to play to [Lost Ark](https://www.playlostark.com/fr-fr/), because their servers are always full atm. So when I was hard-working on discord (kind of), I had to alt-tab, refresh the page to check the servers' status etc: boring. So i thought, let's make a discord bot for that !  

## Quick start

```console
$ python src/main.py
```
